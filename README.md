## What I did-
### Backend: FastAPI
1. Inserts temperature in both celcius and temperature
2. Added authentication for all the endpoints.
3. Used PostgresSQL as a database
4. Redis is used for check rate limiting
5. Websocket endpoint for the real-time data.
6. Added Cron Jobs to demonstrate real-time data.

### Frontend: React
1. Displays real-time charts using Chart.js
2. Connects to the WebSocket for the live updates.
